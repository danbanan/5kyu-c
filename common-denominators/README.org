* Common Denominators
  You will have a list of rationals in the form: ~{{N1, D1}, ... {Nn, Dn}}~ where
  all numbers are positive ints.

  You have to produce a result in the form ~{{N_1, D} ... {N_n, D}}~ in which ~D~
  is as small as possible.

  *Example:* ~convertFracs {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}}~ should return
  ~{{6, 12}, {4, 12}, {3, 12}}~.

** Note
   Due to the fact that first translations were written long ago - more than 4
   years - these translations have only irreducible fractions. Newer
   translations have some reducible fractions. To be on the safe side it is
   better to do a bit more work by simplifying fractions even if they don't have
   to be.
